# Enhancing-the-Job-Hunting-Experience-on-Craigslist
Worked on improving customer experience while job hunting on Craigslist. Scraped job postings from Craigslist using Beautiful Soup and developed a feature that uses text analysis to map an employee's skill to available positions and recommends job postings based on the relevance. The user needs to upload their resume and enter the type of compensation (hourly, monthly, yearly, commission, etc.) desired and the relevant job postings will be recommended. This increases the efficiency of the job search process by eliminating the need for a user to search through multiple categories to find the right opportunity for them.
